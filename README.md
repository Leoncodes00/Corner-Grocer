# Corner-Grocer
This is a console application using C++, that imports a text file named “CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt” and reads the data in the text file. With that data, a menu with four options is created to read and display that data in the different options that the user chooses. These four options are to search an item and display the frequency amount of that specific item in the text file, display and prints each item’s name and its frequency count, print a histogram of that item’s frequencies, and exit the program.
The class, ItemTracker, defines private member variables, that includes a map data structure to hold the item names and their item frequency counts. 
The readDataFile function reads the data file and updates the item frequency map.
The displayMenu function displays the menu options and calls the appropriate menu function based on the user’s choice. 
The searchItem function prompts the user to enter an item and displays the frequency of that item.  
The printFrequencyList function displays the frequency of all items. 
The printHistogram function displays a histogram of the item frequencies.
