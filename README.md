# Corner-Grocer
This is a console application using C++, that imports a text file named “CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt” and reads the data in the text file. With that data, a menu with four options is created to read and display that data in the different options that the user chooses. These four options are to search an item and display the frequency amount of that specific item in the text file, display and prints each item’s name and its frequency count, print a histogram of that item’s frequencies, and exit the program.
